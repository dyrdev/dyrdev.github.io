# Coding Principles and Programming Methodologies Applied

### Component-Based Architecture

- The application is structured using React components (App, DashboardPage, ResumeAnalysisPage, etc.)
- Each component has a single responsibility (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Components are reusable (e.g., the sensei-button styling is applied consistently throughout)

### React Hooks

- Extensive use of React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`
- State management is handled locally within components where appropriate
- Custom hooks could potentially be extracted for reusable logic

### Separation of Concerns

- Clear separation between:
    - UI components (React)
    - Styling (CSS)
    - Structure (HTML)
    - Logic (JavaScript)
- Each file has a distinct purpose (index.html, app.js, styles.css)

### Functional Programming Principles

- Use of pure functions where possible
- Immutable state updates (using spread operator for state updates)
- Array methods like `map` for rendering lists

### Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach with responsive layouts
- Use of Tailwind CSS for responsive utilities (grid, flex, etc.)
- Media queries in CSS for different screen sizes

### User Experience Principles

- Smooth transitions between views (quickSlash, quickFadeOut animations)
- Visual feedback for user interactions (button hover effects)
- Progressive disclosure of information (staggered animations)

### Security Practices

- CAPTCHA implementation for authentication
- Password masking with toggle visibility
- Input validation

### Clean Code Practices

- Descriptive variable and function names
- Consistent code formatting
- Comments where needed (though minimal due to self-documenting code)
- Logical grouping of related code

### Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading of components (conditional rendering)
- Animation optimization with CSS transforms
- Efficient state updates

### Modern CSS Techniques

- CSS variables and custom properties
- CSS animations and transitions
- Flexbox and Grid layouts
- Custom styling for form elements

### Authentication Flow

- Proper login/logout implementation
- Session management
- Protected routes pattern (though simplified in this SPA)

### Error Handling

- Form validation feedback
- Error state management
- User-friendly error messages
